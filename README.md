# auxiliary-feature-fusion-network-speech-inversion
The pytorch code implementation of the paper: 
SPEAKER-INDEPENDENT ACOUSTIC-TO-ARTICULATORY INVERSION BASED ON SPEECH SEPARATION AND AUXILIARY FEATURE FUSION
The following details are details:

pytorchtools.py contains of some important method functions.
model_learning.py and train_learning.py are model and training in No-Fine-tuning scenaire.
model_learning_F01.py is the Speech Separation Module which is pre-trained.
train_learn_F01.py, model_learning.py and model_learning_F01.py are processing of model and training in Fine-tuning scenaire.
